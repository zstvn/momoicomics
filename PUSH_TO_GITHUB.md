# 🚀 Push to GitHub - Quick Guide

## ✅ Repository Setup Complete!

Your frontend code is ready to push to GitHub. The following has been done:

### What's Been Prepared:
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All frontend files committed
- ✅ Backend folder excluded (via .gitignore)
- ✅ Sensitive files excluded (.env, deployment docs)
- ✅ Remote repository added: https://github.com/zstvn/momoicomics.git
- ✅ Branch renamed to `main`

## 📤 Push to GitHub

Run this command to push your code:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### If you encounter authentication issues:

#### Option 1: HTTPS with Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token (classic) with `repo` permissions
3. When prompted for password, use the token instead

#### Option 2: SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:zstvn/momoicomics.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### Option 3: GitHub Desktop
- Open GitHub Desktop
- File → Add Local Repository
- Select: `C:\Users\hitor\Downloads\momoich`
- Publish to GitHub

## 🔍 What's Included in the Repository:

**Included (Frontend only):**
- ✅ Source code (`src/`)
- ✅ Components and pages
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Package.json
- ✅ README.md
- ✅ .gitignore
- ✅ Public assets

**Excluded (via .gitignore):**
- ❌ `backend/` folder (PHP API code)
- ❌ `.env` file (sensitive config)
- ❌ `node_modules/` (dependencies)
- ❌ `dist/` (build output)
- ❌ Backend documentation files

## 📝 After Pushing

1. **Verify on GitHub:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/zstvn/momoicomics
   - Check that all files are uploaded
   - Verify README displays correctly

2. **Update .env locally:**
   - Keep your `.env` file with API configuration
   - Never commit it to GitHub

3. **Set up GitHub Pages (Optional):**
   - Settings → Pages
   - Source: GitHub Actions
   - Deploy using Vite

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Collaborators:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zstvn/momoicomics.git
cd momoicomics
npm install
# Create .env file with VITE_API_URL
npm run dev
```

### To Deploy:
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to your hosting
```

## 🔒 Security Reminder

- ✅ `.env` is excluded from repository
- ✅ Backend code is separate
- ✅ Database credentials not in repo
- ⚠️ Never commit API keys or passwords

## 📞 Need Help?

If push fails:
1. Check GitHub repository exists
2. Verify you have write access
3. Ensure GitHub credentials are set up
4. Try GitHub Desktop as alternative
